# BattleShips
Academic Project

Using IntelliJ IDEA, I created a game called Battleship.

JAVA was used as a programming language.

"Battleship Game" is a game I developed. It's like a mechanism that asks for our ship's deployment after receiving coordinates as input. 
Then that point is assigned to our ship. The computer will then play against us, deploying his fleet. While playing the game, 
the system will display the scores of those who missed the ship and those who successfully won the round.
